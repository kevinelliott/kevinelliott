![Kevin's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kevinelliott&theme=nord&show_icons=true)

I'm a software engineer and product developer who is passionate about open-source, solving interesting problems, and making the world a better place through action. I am actively involved in a variety of hobbyist projects, such as [ADSBExchange](https://adsbexchange.com) (not anymore since the sale) and [Airframes](https://app.airframes.io), and some gutsy open-source projects, such as [Boxel](https://www.boxel.io) (recipe-driven embedded operating system based on Linux and Docker) and various Tezos-related projects.
