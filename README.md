I'm a software engineer, product developer and entrepreneur who is passionate about open-source, solving interesting problems, and making the world a better place through action. I am actively involved in a variety of software-defined radio projects, such as [ADSBExchange](https://adsbexchange.com) (for more than 5 years, but not anymore since the sale) and [Airframes](https://app.airframes.io) (https://github.com/airframesio), and some various open-source projects, such as [Alias](https://github.com/aliasdotso) and [Boxel](https://www.boxel.io) (recipe-driven embedded operating system based on Linux and Docker).
